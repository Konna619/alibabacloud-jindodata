Use JindoFuse to access Alibaba Cloud OSS-HDFS (JindoFS)
Alibaba Cloud OSS-HDFS (JindoFS) uses JindoFuse to provide POSIX support. JindoFuse allows you to mount OSS-HDFS objects to an on-premises file system. This way, you can perform operations on OSS-HDFS objects in the same manner as you perform operations on files in the on-premises file system. 
Basic usage
Prepare an environment
# CentOS
yum install -y fuse3 fuse3-devel
# Debian
apt install -y fuse3 libfuse3-dev
Configure a client
Configure a directory

- Configure the JINDOSDK_CONF_DIR parameter to specify the directory in which you want to store a configuration file.

The following example shows how to configure the /usr/lib/jindosdk-4.6.12/conf directory as the storage directory of the file jindosdk.cfg.
export JINDOSDK_CONF_DIR=/usr/lib/jindosdk-4.6.12/conf
Prepare a configuration file
Prepare a configuration file in the .ini format. In this example, the name of the file is jindosdk.cfg. The following code shows the configuration items in the file:
[common]
logger.dir = /tmp/fuse-log

[jindosdk]
# Configure the endpoint of the bucket for which OSS-HDFS is enabled. For example, if the bucket is created in the China (Hangzhou) region, the endpoint is cn-hangzhou.oss-dls.aliyuncs.com. 
fs.oss.endpoint = <your_endpoint>
# Configure the AccessKey ID and AccessKey secret that you use to access OSS-HDFS. The AccessKey pair of an Alibaba Cloud account has permissions on all API operations. Using these credentials to perform operations in OSS-HDFS is a high-risk operation. We recommend that you use a RAM user to call API operations or perform routine O&M. To create a RAM user, log on to the RAM console. 
fs.oss.accessKeyId = <your_key_id>
fs.oss.accessKeySecret = <your_key_secret>
Access OSS-HDFS without a password
Prerequisites: An Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instance is used and is assigned a required role. Sample code:
[common]
logger.dir = /tmp/fuse-log

[jindosdk]
# Configure the endpoint of the bucket for which OSS-HDFS is enabled. For example, if the bucket is created in the China (Hangzhou) region, the endpoint is cn-hangzhou.oss-dls.aliyuncs.com. 
fs.oss.endpoint = <your_endpoint>
fs.oss.provider.endpoint = ECS_ROLE
fs.oss.provider.format = JSON
Mount JindoFuse
After you configure JindoSDK, you can perform the following operations. 
Create a mount point
mkdir -p <mount_point>
Mount JindoFuse
jindo-fuse <mount_point> -ouri=[<oss_path>]
You must set the -ouri parameter to the OSS path that you want to map. The path can be the root directory or a subdirectory of the bucket. After you run the command, a daemon process starts in the background to mount the OSS path that is specified by the oss_path parameter to the mount point that is specified by the mount_point parameter for the on-premises file system. 
Access JindoFuse
If you mount OSS-HDFS to an on-premises directory, you can run the following commands to perform related operations in JindoFuse. In this example, OSS-HDFS is mounted to /mnt/oss/. 

- List all directories in /mnt/oss/
- ls /mnt/oss/
- Create a directory
- mkdir /mnt/oss/dir1
- ls /mnt/oss/
- Write data to a file
- echo "hello world" > /mnt/oss/dir1/hello.txt
- Read data from a file
- cat /mnt/oss/dir1/hello.txt

hello world is displayed. 

- Delete the directory
- rm -rf /mnt/oss/dir1/

Unmount JindoFuse
Run the following command to unmount a mount point:
umount <mount_point>
Implement automatic unmounting of JindoFuse
You can configure the -oauto_unmount parameter to implement automatic unmounting of a mount point. 
After you configure the -oauto_unmount parameter, you can run the killall -9 jindo-fuse command to send SIGINT to the jindo-fuse process. This way, JindoFuse is automatically unmounted before the process exits. 
Supported POSIX-based API operations
The following table describes the POSIX-based API operations that JindoFuse allows you to call.

| Operation | Description |

| getattr() | Queries the attributes of an object. This operation is similar to the ls command. |
| mkdir() | Creates a directory. This operation is similar to the mkdir command. |
| rmdir() | Deletes a directory. This operation is similar to the rm -rf command. |

- You can specify both JindoSDK configuration parameters and mount parameters when you mount JindoFuse. The parameters that you configure when you mount JindoFuse have a higher priority than those in the configuration file. Example:

jindo-fuse <mount_point> -ouri=[<oss_path>] -ofs.oss.endpoint=[<your_endpoint>] -ofs.oss.accessKeyId=[<your_key_id>] -ofs.oss.accessKeySecret=[<your_key_secret>]
FAQ
Input/Output error
If you use JindoSDK to call API operations and the API operations fail, you can receive detailed error messages. If you call JindoFuse API operations and the API operations fail, the system sends you only error messages that are preset in the operating system. Sample common errors:
$ ls /mnt/oss/
ls: /mnt/oss/: Input/output error
To identify the cause of an error, view the jindosdk.log file in the path that is specified by the logger.dir parameter of JindoSDK. 
For example, the following error message in the jindosdk.log file indicates that a common authentication error occurs.
