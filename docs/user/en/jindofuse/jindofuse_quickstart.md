# JindoFuse Usage Guide

## Overview

JindoFuse enables POSIX support for OSS/OSS-HDFS, allowing you to mount OSS/OSS-HDFS files locally as if they were part of the local file system.

## Deployment and Installation

Download the latest tar.gz package named `jindosdk-x.y.z.tar.gz` (where x.y.z represents the version), from the [download page](../jindosdk/jindosdk_download.md).

Follow the instructions in the [documentation link](../jindosdk/jindosdk_deployment_ai.md) to install and deploy JindoSDK.

## Mounting JindoFuse

After configuring JindoSDK:

1. Create a mount point with the command below:

```bash
mkdir -p <mountpoint>
```
2. Mount JindoFuse using:

```bash
jindo-fuse <mount_point> -ouri=<osspath>
```

This command starts a background daemon process that mounts `<oss_path>` to `<mount_point>` on the local file system.

Replace `<mount_point>` with a local path, and `<oss_path>` with the desired OSS/OSS-HDFS path, which can be either a bucket root directory or a subdirectory. For example: `oss://examplebucket.cn-shanghai.oss-dls.aliyuncs.com/subdir/`. Refer to [OSS/OSS-HDFS Quick Start](../oss/oss_quickstart.md) for root path examples.

The way to mount paths is similar between OSS and OSS-HDFS, except for slight differences in endpoints.

1. Verify successful mounting by checking that the jindo-fuse process exists and has the expected parameters:

```bash
ps -ef | grep jindo-fuse
```

## Accessing JindoFuse

Assuming you've mounted JindoFS service at `/mnt/oss/`, perform these operations:

1. List all directories in `/mnt/oss/`:

```bash
ls /mnt/oss/
```

2. Create a directory:

```bash
mkdir /mnt/oss/dir1
ls /mnt/oss/
```

3. Write a file:

```bash
echo "hello world" > /mnt/oss/dir1/hello.txt
```

4. Read the file:

```bash
cat /mnt/oss/dir1/hello.txt
```

It displays `hello world`.

5. Remove the directory:

```bash
rm -rf /mnt/oss/dir1/
```

## Unmounting JindoFuse

To unmount the previously mounted point, run:

```bash
umount <mount_point>
```

## Automatic Unmounting JindoFuse

Use the `-oauto_unmount` option to automatically unmount when the mount point is no longer needed.

With this parameter, sending `killall -9 jindo-fuse` sends a SIGINT signal to the jindo-fuse process, which will safely unmount before exiting.

For more options, see [Common Client Configurations](../jindosdk/jindosdk_configuration.md).

*   Supports specifying jindosdk configuration settings alongside mount options (options passed at mount time take precedence over configurations), e.g.:

```bash
jindo-fuse <mount_point> -ouri=<osspath> -ofs.oss.endpoint=<your_endpoint> -ofs.oss.accessKeyId=<your_key_id> -ofs.oss.accessKeySecret=<your_key_secret>
```

# Common Issues

## Input/Output Error

Unlike using JindoSDK APIs that provide detailed ErrorMsg, JindoFuse shows generic operating system errors such as:

```bash
$ ls /mnt/oss/
ls: /mnt/oss/: Input/output error
```

To troubleshoot specific issues, look in the log file located at the path specified by `logger.dir` (`jindosdk.log`). For instance, an authorization issue might appear as:

> EMMDD HH:mm:ss jindofs_connectivity.cpp:13] Please check your Endpoint/Bucket/RoleArn. Failed test connectivity, operation: mkdir, errMsg: [RequestId]: 618B8183343EA53531C62B74 [HostId]: oss-cn-shanghai-internal.aliyuncs.com [ErrorMessage]: [E1010]HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden ...
