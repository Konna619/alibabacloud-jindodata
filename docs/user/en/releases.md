# JindoSDK Release History

## Version 6.4.0, April 11, 2024

- JindoFuse now supports specifying `metrics_ip` and `metrics_port` to designate the Prometheus listening IP address and port.
- A fix has been implemented for the Delegation Token Renew mechanism in JindoOssFileSystem.
- An issue has been resolved where `fs.accessPolicies.discovery` without a trailing `/` caused an error with `getTrashRoot` being empty (affects only version 6.3.3).
