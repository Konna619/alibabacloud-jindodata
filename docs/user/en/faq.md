- **What is the relationship between JindoData and Alibaba Cloud EMR? **

JindoData is a suite developed by the big data JindoData team of Alibaba Cloud. JindoData is available for open source ecosystems and communities. JindoData is integrated with E-MapReduce (EMR) by default. JindoData can also be deployed in various scenarios in Alibaba Cloud, such as self-managed clusters that are deployed on Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances, Fluid in the cloud-native AI suite of Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK), and data centers. Alibaba Cloud EMR provides various cluster types, such as DataLake, Dataflow, Data Science, and online analytical processing (OLAP). Different JindoData components are integrated into different types of EMR clusters by default to provide more optimized and easier-to-use experience. 

- **What is the relationship between JindoData and EMR SmartData? **

JindoData is formerly known as SmartData of EMR developed by Alibaba Cloud. JindoData is upgraded based on the architecture of SmartData. JindoData is modularized and highly compatible with open source ecosystems and communities. 

- **What is the relationship between JindoData and JindoFS? **

JindoData is built on top of a unified architecture and kernel. JindoData provides the following components: JindoFS (the original JindoFS in block storage mode), JindoFSx (the original JindoFS in cache mode), and JindoSDK. JindoData also provides ecosystem tools and plug-ins.

- **What is the relationship between JindoFS and OSS-HDFS?**

JindoFS is deployed as a service called OSS-HDFS in Alibaba Cloud. OSS-HDFS is deeply integrated with Object Storage Service (OSS). You can directly use OSS-HDFS without the need to deploy and manage JindoFS. 

- **Why is JindoFS used as a service called OSS-HDFS? **

JindoFS is binary compatible with Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and optimizes the user experience of HDFS and data migration. This way, data in self-managed HDFS clusters can be smoothly migrated to Alibaba Cloud OSS.
